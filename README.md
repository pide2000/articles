Repository for my blog articles and to encourage some "crowd authoring"


# WHY? 
The awesome ipxe community was very happy about my first article. But they told me there are some typos and grammatical failures. (English is not my native language)
Therefore I decided to push the articles to this repo. Here ppl can help by creating a pull request with corrections.

If there are wrong descriptions or other failures in the content feel free to create a pull request also.
